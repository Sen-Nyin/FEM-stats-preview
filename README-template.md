## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Mix-blend-modes for image overlays

### What I learned

At first I set the images up with a linear-gradient overlay, but noticed the colouring didn't perfectly match the example. I had to go away and learn about mix-blend-mode to get the job done, setting a background colour to the main image container and set the image as a background to an ::after.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.stats__image::after {
  content: "";
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: url(../images/image-header-mobile.jpg);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
  opacity: 0.75;
}
```

### Continued development

I think this project highlighted my need to do some additional research on image backgrounds. I had originally planned to use the picture element with media sources to switch between the mobile and desktop images, but found this approach problematic with the sizing, so switched to CSS backgrounds.
